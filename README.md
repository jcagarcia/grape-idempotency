## Installation üßó

Ruby 2.6 or newer is required.
[Grape](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape) 1 or newer is required.

`grape-idempotency` is available as a gem, to install it run:

```bash
gem install grape-idempotency
```

## Basic Usage üìñ

Configure the `Grape::Idempotency` class with a `Redis` instance.

```ruby
require 'redis'
require 'grape-idempotency'

redis = Redis.new(host: 'localhost', port: 6379)
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = redis
end
```

Now you can wrap your code inside the `idempotent` method:

```ruby
require 'grape'
require 'grape-idempotency'

class API < Grape::API
    post '/payments' do
      idempotent do
        status 201
        Payment.create!({
          amount: params[:amount]
        })
      end
    end
  end
end
```

That's all! üöÄ

## How it works ü§î

Once you've set up the gem and enclosed your endpoint code within the `idempotent` method, your endpoint will exhibit idempotent behavior, but this will only occur if the consumer of the endpoint includes an idempotency key in their request. (If you want to make the idempotency key header mandatory for your endpoint, check [How to make idempotency key header mandatory](#making-idempotency-key-header-mandatory-) section)

This key allows your consumer to make the same request again in case of a connection error, without the risk of creating a duplicate object or executing the update twice.

To execute an idempotent request, simply request your user to include an extra `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header as part of his request.

This gem operates by storing the initial request's status code and response body, regardless of whether the request succeeded or failed, using a specific idempotency key. Subsequent requests with the same key will consistently yield the same result, even if there were 500 errors.

Keys are automatically removed from the system if they are at least 24 hours old, and a new request is generated when a key is reused after the original has been removed. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and returns a `422 - Unprocessable Entity` status code if they don't match, preventing accidental misuse.
If a request is received while another one with the same idempotency key is still being processed the idempotency layer returns a `409 - Conflict` status

Results are only saved if an API endpoint begins its execution. If incoming parameters fail validation or if the request conflicts with another one executing concurrently, no idempotent result is stored because no API endpoint has initiated execution. In such cases, retrying these requests is safe.

Additionally, this gem automatically appends the `Original-Request` header and the `Idempotency-Key` header to your API's response, enabling you to trace back to the initial request that generated that specific response.

## Making idempotency key header mandatory ‚ö†Ô∏è

For some endpoints, you want to enforce your consumers to provide idempotency key. So, when wrapping the code inside the `idempotent` method, you can mark it as `required`:

```ruby
require 'grape'
require 'grape-idempotency'

class API < Grape::API
    post '/payments' do
      idempotent(required: true) do
        status 201
        Payment.create!({
          amount: params[:amount]
        })
      end
    end
  end
end
```

If the Idempotency-Key request header is missing for a idempotent operation requiring this header, the gem will reply with an HTTP 400 status code with the following body:

```json
{
  "title": "Idempotency-Key is missing",
  "detail": "This operation is idempotent and it requires correct usage of Idempotency Key.",
}
```

If you want to change the error message returned in this scenario, check [How to configure idempotency key missing error message](#mandatory_header_response) section.

## Configuration ü™ö

In addition to the storage aspect, you have the option to supply additional configuration details to tailor the gem to the specific requirements of your project.

### expires_in

As we have mentioned in the [How it works](#how-it-works-) section, keys are automatically removed from the system if they are at least 24 hours old. However, a 24-hour timeframe may not be suitable for your project. To accommodate your specific needs, you can adjust this duration by using the `expires_in` parameter for configuration:

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.expires_in = 1800
end
```

So with the cofiguration above, the keys will expire in 30 minutes.

### idempotency_key_header

As outlined in the [How it works](#how-it-works-) section, in order to perform an idempotent request, you need to instruct your users to include an additional `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header with their request. However, if this header format doesn't align with your project requirements, you have the flexibility to configure the specific header that the gem will examine to determine idempotent behavior:

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.idempotency_key_header = "x-custom-idempotency-key"
end
```

Given the previous configuration, the gem will examine the `X-Custom-Idempotency-Key: <key>` for determine the idempotent behavior.

### request_id_header

By default, this gem stores a random hex value as identifier when storing the original request and returns it in all the subsequent requests that use the same idempotency-key as `Original-Request` header in the response.

This value can be also provided by your consumer using the `X-Request-Id: <request-id>` header when performing the request to your API.

However, if you prefer to use a different format for getting the request identifier, you can configure the header to check using the `request_id_header` parameter:

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.request_id_header = "x-trace-id"
end
```

In the case above, you request your consumers to use the `X-Trace-Id: <trace-id>` header when requesting your API.

### logger, logger_level and logger_prefix

By default, the logger used by the gem is configured like `Logger.new(STDOUT)` and `INFO` level. As this gem does not log any message with `INFO` level, only `ERROR` messages will be logged.


If you want to provide your own logger, you want to change the level to `DEBUG` or you want to provide your own prefix, you can configure the gem like:

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.logger = Infrastructure::MyLogger.new
  c.logger_level = :debug
  c.logger_prefix = '[my-own-prefix]'
end
```

An example of the logged information when changing the level of the log to `DEBUG` and customizing the `logger_prefix`:

```shell
I, [2023-11-23T22:41:39.148163 #1]  DEBUG -- : [my-own-prefix] Performing endpoint "/payments" with idempotency.
I, [2023-11-23T22:41:39.148176 #1]  DEBUG -- : [my-own-prefix] Idempotency key is NOT mandatory for this endpoint.

I, [2023-11-23T22:41:39.148537 #1]  DEBUG -- : [my-own-prefix] Returning the response from the original request.
```

### conflict_error_response

When providing a `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header, this gem compares incoming parameters to those of the original request (if exists) and returns a `409 - Conflict` status code if they don't match, preventing accidental misuse. The response body returned by the gem looks like:

```json
{

  "title": "Idempotency-Key is already used",
  "detail": "This operation is idempotent and it requires correct usage of Idempotency Key. Idempotency Key MUST not be reused across different payloads of this operation."
}
```

You have the option to specify the desired response body to be returned to your users when this error occurs. This allows you to align the error format with the one used in your application.

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.conflict_error_response = {
    "type": "about:blank",
    "status": 409,
    "title": "Conflict",
    "detail": "You are using the same idempotent key for two different requests"
}
end
```

In the configuration above, the error is following the [RFC-7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) format.

### processing_response

When a request with a `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header is performed while a previous one still on going with the same idempotency value, this gem returns a `409 - Conflict` status. The response body returned by the gem looks like:

```json
{

  "title": "A request is outstanding for this Idempotency-Key",
  "detail": "A request with the same idempotent key for the same operation is being processed or is outstanding."
}
```

You have the option to specify the desired response body to be returned to your users when this error occurs. This allows you to align the error format with the one used in your application.

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.processing_response = {
    "type": "about:blank",
    "status": 409,
    "title": "A request is still being processed",
    "detail": "A request with the same idempotent key is being procesed"
}
end
```

In the configuration above, the error is following the [RFC-7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) format.

### mandatory_header_response

If the Idempotency-Key request header is missing for a idempotent operation requiring this header, the gem will reply with an HTTP 400 status code with the following body:

```json
{
  "title": "Idempotency-Key is missing",
  "detail": "This operation is idempotent and it requires correct usage of Idempotency Key.",
}
```

You have the option to specify the desired response body to be returned to your users when this error occurs. This allows you to align the error format with the one used in your application.

```ruby
Grape::Idempotency.configure do |c|
  c.storage = @storage
  c.mandatory_header_response = {
    "type": "about:blank",
    "status": 400,
    "title": "Idempotency-Key is missing",
    "detail": "Please, provide a valid idempotent key in the headers for performing this operation"
}
end
```

In the configuration above, the error is following the [RFC-7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) format.
